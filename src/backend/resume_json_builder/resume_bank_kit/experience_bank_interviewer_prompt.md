      "quote": "Shipment Report Automation was my internship project at Example Logistics, June through August 2026. The project is complete and is used internally by three operations analysts. The problem was a repetitive manual weekly report. I personally wrote the CSV ingestion, SQL validation queries, report-generation Python code, and pytest tests. Another engineer configured deployment and credentials. I used Python, pandas, PostgreSQL, SQL, pytest, and Git. The architecture was scheduled CSV ingestion into PostgreSQL, validation queries, then a generated spreadsheet report. I chose SQL for validation because the checks compared multiple tables; my manager approved that choice. I implemented retry handling for missing source files and rejected duplicate shipment IDs. The data comprised approximately 10,000 shipment rows per weekly report; this is an approximate row count, not a user count. There were four engineers on the team and I did not lead it. Across five before-and-after weekly runs in August, the three analysts reported a mean combined preparation time of 120 minutes before and 35 minutes after per report. This measured analyst preparation time, not system runtime. I wrote 18 automated tests covering missing columns, duplicate IDs, and report totals. Analysts checked totals against the prior manual report before release. I initially treated blank IDs as valid; I fixed the validation after an analyst found the error. Internal source code is confidential; the project can be described publicly without customer data. I do not have a public project link."

      "quote": "Campus Demand Forecast was a completed course project from January through April 2026. We were a team of three. I personally implemented the ridge-regression baseline, chronological data split, and leakage checks in Python, NumPy, and scikit-learn. A teammate implemented the neural-network model. We used 24 months of synthetic hourly demand data supplied by the instructor. I chose chronological rather than random splitting to avoid using future data in training. The last four months were the held-out test set. My ridge baseline had a mean absolute error of 12.4 demand units; the same test set gave 15.8 for the seasonal-naive baseline. The figures describe synthetic course data, not business results. I validated the split with assertions and manually inspected feature timestamps. Initially, a rolling feature included the current target; I shifted it before evaluation. We submitted a class report and demonstration. Nothing was deployed. The public demo is at https://example.com/projects/campus-demand."

So far, I have implemented a Python file-replay reader, a fixed-size ring buffer, and NumPy moving-average filtering, with a Matplotlib visualization. I used a ring buffer to bound memory use. I tested that replay preserves sample ordering and that the buffer stays at its configured size of 500 samples. The current implementation only replays recorded files. Live Bluetooth input is a future plan and is not implemented. There are no external users and I have not measured a production latency.
